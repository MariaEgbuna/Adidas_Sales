## Data Cleaning Performed (Step 1)
Prior to further analysis, a critical data cleaning step was executed using Microsoft Excel:
* **Issue:** The `Total Sales` column initially contained systematic data entry errors, with many values being ten times higher than the actual product of `Price per Unit` and `Units Sold`.
* **Correction:** For all affected rows, the `Total Sales` value was corrected by dividing it by 10.
* **Result:** The `Total Sales` column is now accurate and consistent, ensuring the integrity of the sales figures for reliable analysis.

## EDA (Step 2)
The analysis is based on the `Adidas_US_Sales.csv` dataset, which contains detailed sales records including:
* `retailer`, `retailer_id`
* `invoice_date`
* `region`, `state`, `city`
* `product`
* `price_per_unit`, `units_sold`, `total_sales`
* `operating_profit`, `operating_margin_percent`
* `sales_method`

## Analysis Goals

The EDA was structured around several key areas of inquiry:
1.  **Performance Analysis**: Examining overall sales and profit performance.
2.  **Regional and Temporal Trends**: Investigating how sales and profit vary by geographic region and over time.
3.  **Profitability Insights**: Deep diving into profit margins across different dimensions.
4.  **Product-Specific Analysis**: Looking closely at individual product performance metrics.

## Tools Used
* **DBeaver**: For database management and running SQL queries.
* **PSQL (PostgreSQL)**: The relational database management system used for executing the analysis queries.
* **SQL**: Primary language for data extraction and aggregation.
